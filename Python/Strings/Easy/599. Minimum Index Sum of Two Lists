Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
Example 2:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
Example 3:

Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
Output: ["sad","happy"]
Explanation: There are three common strings:
"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".

Solution:
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        out_list1={}
        out_list2={}
        mid_res={}
        final_out =[]
        for i in range(0,len(list1)):
            for j in range(0,len(list2)):
                if list1[i]==list2[j]:
                    out_list1[list1[i]]=i
                    out_list2[list2[j]]=j
        for i,j in out_list1.items():
            for k,v in out_list2.items():
                cal=0
                if i==k:
                    cal =j+v
                    mid_res[i]=cal
        min_val =min(mid_res.values())
        for i,j in mid_res.items():
            if j==min_val:
                final_out.append(i)
        return final_out
