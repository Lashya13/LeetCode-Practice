1768. Merge Strings Alternately

correct answer:

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        l1,l2 =len(word1),len(word2)
        merged =""

        for i in range(min(l1,l2)):
            merged = merged +word1[i]
            merged = merged +word2[i]
    

        merged += word1[l2:] if l1 > l2 else word2[l1:]

        return merged
